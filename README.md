# Kmeans_Image_Clustering
In this project, we will use a K-means algorithm to perform image classification. Clustering isn't limited to the consumer information and population sciences, it can be used for imagery analysis as well. Using Scikit-learn and the MNIST dataset, we will investigate the use of K-means clustering for computer vision.


# In this project, we: 

1. Preprocess images for clustering
2. Deploy K-means clustering algorithms
3. Use common metrics to evaluate cluster performance
4. Visualize high-dimensional cluster centroids
